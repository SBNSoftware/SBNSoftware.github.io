SBND code organization
================================================================

The SBND code repository (`sbndcode`) currently depends on `sbndutil`,`sbnd_data`, `larsoft`, and `cetbuildtools` (for building). In all releases with number greater than 3.8.2, the `lar1ncode`/`sbndcode` number matches the underlying `larsoft` version.\
`sbndutil` versions are independent. Also, `sbndutil` is an \"optional\" dependency. So, on [Fermilab GPVMs](Computing_resources.html#Where-to-work-interactive-nodes-GPVM) it will be set up but offsite it will not be set up unless it is available: usually it is not. If you are building your own `sbndcode` with MRB, you can check out also `sbndutil` (`mrb g sbndutil`) and when you build the area `sbndutil` will be available to you.

See the (soon to be done) section on getting `sbndcode` offsite for more detailed information.
